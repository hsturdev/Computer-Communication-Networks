# Tiny TCP
* TCP is the a reliable transport layer protocol that transfer data over the Internet, most of the files transfers on the Internet using TCP, another most common transport layer protocol is UDP, but it considers as unreliable and it mostly used in live streaming.
* This project implement a reliable transport layer protocol(tinytcp).
* tinytcp deliver a stream of bytes reliably and in-order to applications over the network
* Unlike complete version of TCP, tonytcp does not have flpw control and congestion control
* The testing occurs on the virtual envirnment on local host, but after applying some setings it can also be used in the real world envirment, so people can use it to transfer files from one machine to another remotely.
* This is one of the my course project, please **read only, do not share, copy and distribute it**, especially if you are student who is taking the same/similar course
